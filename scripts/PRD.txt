# Overview  
This project implements a modular retrieval system using GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Neo4j as the graph database. The initial version will use simple example data to demonstrate core functionality. The system is designed to be extensible, allowing for future integration of additional retrieval methods (e.g., agent calls, external API calls). The retrieval module will be built for easy import and use by other API services that interact with AI models.

# Core Features  
- **GraphRAG Retrieval with Neo4j**  
  - Implements basic retrieval using GraphRAG principles on a Neo4j database.
  - Uses simple example data for demonstration and testing.
  - Provides a clean, well-documented API for retrieval operations.

- **Modular & Extensible Retrieval Process**  
  - The retrieval logic is designed as a module, making it easy to import and use in other services.
  - The architecture anticipates future expansion to support additional retrieval methods (e.g., agent-based, external APIs).

# User Experience  
- **User Personas**:  
  - AI/ML engineers integrating retrieval-augmented generation into their pipelines.
  - Backend developers building API services that require flexible retrieval modules.

- **Key User Flows**:  
  - Developer imports the retrieval module into their API service.
  - Developer initializes the module with Neo4j connection and example data.
  - Developer calls the retrieval function to fetch relevant data for AI service.

- **UI/UX Considerations**:  
  - No direct UI; focus is on developer experience and API clarity.

# Technical Architecture  
- **System Components**:  
  - Retrieval module (core logic)
  - Neo4j database (local or cloud)
  - Example data loader
  - API interface for retrieval

# Data Models

For the MVP, we will collect and represent the following types of data as nodes in the graph:

- **Federal Regulation**
  - Fields: Name, Citation, Description, Effective Date, Full Text (optional), Category

- **Agency Guidance**
  - Fields: Title, Agency, Date Issued, Summary, Reference Number, Category

- **Enforcement Action**
  - Fields: Title/Case Name, Agency, Date, Summary, Docket/Case Number, Outcome, Category

- **Compliance Topic**
  - Fields: Name, Description, Related Regulations (text), Category

We will focus on collecting a small set of example data for each type to demonstrate the retrieval process.

- **APIs and Integrations**:  
  - Internal API for retrieval (function or class interface)
  - (Future) Hooks for agent calls, external API calls

- **Infrastructure Requirements**:  
  - Neo4j instance (Docker or cloud)
  - Python (or your chosen language) environment

# Development Roadmap  
- **MVP Requirements**:  
  - Implement basic GraphRAG retrieval logic using Neo4j and example data
  - Provide a simple API for retrieval
  - Package as a module for import/use in other services

- **Future Enhancements**:  
  - Add support for agent-based retrieval
  - Integrate external API retrieval options
  - Expand data model and retrieval strategies

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Set up Neo4j instance and load example data
- Implement core retrieval logic (GraphRAG)
- Expose retrieval as a module/API
- (Future) Add extensibility hooks for new retrieval methods

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Technical challenges**:  
  - Ensuring modularity and extensibility from the start  
    *Mitigation*: Use clear interfaces and documentation.
  - Neo4j setup and data modeling  
    *Mitigation*: Start with simple example data and schema.

- **MVP scoping**:  
  - Avoid over-engineering for future features  
    *Mitigation*: Focus on basic retrieval first, design for extension.
